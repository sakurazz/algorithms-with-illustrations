## 1. 问题是这样子：
	
Given a string S and a string T, find **the minimum window** in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n). For example,
	
- S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
- T = "ABC"
	
Minimum window is "**BANC**".

## 2. 一个理想的思路是：
	
1. 求一个范围立马想到双指针：**一个指头，一个指尾。**
2. 先找满足条件的一个解，然后在走的过程，不断用限制条件看看能不能得到更好的解。

text from [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/solution/)

- sliding window
- In any sliding window based problem we have two pointers. One `right` pointer whose job is to expand the current window and then we have the `left` pointer whose job is to **contract** a given window. At any point in time only one of these pointers move and the other one remains fixed. 
- We keep expanding the window by moving the right pointer. When the window has all the desired characters, we contract (if possible) and save the smallest window till now.

``` python
import collections
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        seats = collections.Counter(t)
        count = len(t)
        head = 0
        longest = float("inf")
        res = [None, None]
        
        for tail, char in enumerate(s):
            if char in seats:
                if seats[char] > 0:
                    count -= 1
                seats[char] -= 1
            while count == 0:
                if tail - head + 1 < longest:
                    longest = tail - head + 1
                    res = [head, tail]
                longest = min(tail - head + 1, longest)
                char = s[head]
                if char in seats:
                    if seats[char] >= 0:
                        count += 1
                    seats[char] += 1
                head += 1
        return s[res[0]:res[1]+1] if longest != float("inf") else "" 
```
