## CheatSheet 

## Linked List 

List problems often have a simple brute-force solution that uses 0(n) space, but a subtler solution that uses **the existing list nodes** to reduce space complexity to 0(1). 

Very often, a problem on lists is conceptually simple, and is more about **cleanly coding what's specified**, rather than designing an algorithm.

Consider using **a dummy head** (sometimes referred to as a sentinel) to avoid having to check for empty lists. This simplifies code, and makes bugs less likely. 

It's easy to forget **to update next** (and previous for double linked list) for the head and tail.

Algorithms operating on singly linked lists often benefit from using **two iterators**, one ahead of the other, or **one advancing quicker than the other**.

## Stack[LIFO]

### Study notes

### Notes
Learn to recognize when the stack **LIFO** property is applicable. For example, **parsing** typically benefits from a stack. 

Consider augmenting the basic stack or queue data structure to support additional operations, such as **finding the maximum element**. 

### key words
- LIFO: 901

### Corner cases

## Heap 

### Study Links
Learning to Love Heaps

### Notes
Use a heap when all you care about is the **largest** or **smallest** elements, and you do not need to support fast lookup, delete, or search operations for arbitrary elements. [Problem 11.1]

A heap is a good choice when you need to compute the k **largest** or k **smallest** elements in a collection. For the former, use a min-heap, for the latter, use a max-heap. [Problem 11.4]

### Key words 
- top / lowest k: [347](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/)

#### Corner cases

## Binary Tree

### Study notes

 **Recursive algorithms** are well-suited to problems on trees. Remember to include space implicitly allocated on the **function call stack** when doing space complexity analysis. 
 
Some tree problems have simple brute-force solutions that use 0(n) space solution, but subtler solutions that uses the **existing tree nodes** to reduce space complexity to 0( 1). 

Consider **left- and right-skewed trees** when doing complexity analysis. Note that 0(h) complexity, where h is the tree height, translates into 0(log n) complexity for balanced trees, but 0(n) complexity for skewed trees. [Problem 10.12]

If each node has a **parent field**, use it to make your code simpler, and to reduce time and space complexity. [Problem 10.10]

It's easy to make the **mistake** of treating a node that has a single child as a leaf.

## BST 

### Study notes

### Notes
 With a BST you can **iterate** through elements in sorted order in time 0(n) (regard- less of whether it is balanced). 
 
Some problems need **a combination of a BST and a hashtable**. For example, if you insert student objects into a BST and entries are ordered by GPA, and then a student's GPA needs to be updated and all we have is the student's name and new GPA, we cannot find the student by name without a full traversal. However, with an additional hash table, we can directly go to the corresponding entry in the tree. 

Sometimes, it's necessary to **augment** a BST, e.g., the number of nodes at a subtree in addition to its key, or the range of values sorted in the subtree. 

The BST property is **a global property**—a binary tree may have the property that each node's key is greater than the key at its left child and smaller than the key at its right child, but it may not be a BST.

## Trie 

### Study notes

### Notes
Tries are special trees (prefix trees) that make searching and storing strings more efficient. Tries have many practical applications, such as conducting **searches** and providing **autocomplete**. It is helpful to know these common applications so that you can easily identify when a problem can be efficiently solved using a trie.

Sometimes preprocessing a dictionary of **words** (given in a list) into a trie, will improve the efficiency of searching for a word of length k, among n words. Searching becomes O(k) instead of O(n).

Be familiar with implementing, from scratch, a Trie class and its `add`, `remove` and `search` methods.

## Segment Tree 

### Study notes

### Notes
In computer science, a segment tree also known as a statistic tree is a tree data structure used for storing information about intervals, or segments. It allows querying which of the stored segments contain a given point. It is, in principle, a static structure; that is, it's a structure that cannot be modified once it's built. A similar data structure is the interval tree.  - from wiki

## Graph 

### Study notes

### Notes
 It's natural to use a graph when the problem involves **spatially connected** objects, e.g., road segments between cities. 
  
More generally, consider using a graph when you need to analyze **any binary relationship**, between objects, such as interlinked webpages, followers in a social graph, etc. 

Some graph problems entail **analyzing structure**, e.g., looking for cycles or connected components. DFS works particularly well for these applications. 

Some graph problems are related to **optimization**, e.g., find the shortest path from one vertex to another. **BFS, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and minimum spanning tree** are examples of graph algorithms appropriate for optimization problems.

## DP



### Study notes

- [Dynamic Programming – 7 Steps to Solve any DP Interview Problem](http://blog.refdash.com/dynamic-programming-tutorial-example/)

### Notes

Consider using DP whenever you have to **make choices** to arrive at the solution, specifically, when the solution relates to subproblems.

In addition to optimization problems, DP is also **applicable** to **counting and decision problems**—any problem where you can express a solution recursively in terms of the same computation on smaller instances.

Although conceptually DP involves recursion, often for efficiency the cache is **built "bottom-up"**, i.e., iteratively. [Problem 17.3].

To save space, **cache space** may be **recycled** once it is known that a set of entries will not be looked up again. [Problems 17.1 and 17.2]

Sometimes, **recursion may out-perform a bottom-up DP** solution, e.g., when the solution is found early or subproblems can be **pruned** through bounding. [Problem 17.5]

## Backtracking 


[A general approach to backtracking questions in Java (Subsets, Permutations, Combination Sum, Palindrome Partioning)](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/discuss/18239/a-general-approach-to-backtracking-questions-in-java-subsets-permutations-combination-sum-palindrome-partioning)

### Study notes

基本概念：
backtracking（回溯算法）也叫试探法，它是一种系统地搜索问题的解的方法。回溯算法的基本思想是：从一条路往前走，能进则进，不能进则退回来，换一条路再试。

回溯算法说白了就是穷举法。不过回溯算法使用剪枝函数，剪去一些不可能到达最终状态（即答案状态）的节点，从而减少状态空间树节点的生成。 
回溯法是一个既带有系统性又带有跳跃性的的搜索算法。它在包含问题的所有解的解空间树中，按照深度优先的策略，从根结点出发搜索解空间树。算法搜索至解空间树的任一结点时，总是先判断该结点是否肯定不包含问题的解。如果肯定不包含，则跳过对以该结点为根的子树的系统搜索，逐层向其祖先结点回溯。否则，进入该子树，继续按深度优先的策略进行搜索。

回溯法在用来求问题的所有解时，要回溯到根，且根结点的所有子树都已被搜索遍才结束。
而回溯法在用来求问题的任一解时，只要搜索到问题的一个解就可以结束。
这种以深度优先的方式系统地搜索问题的解的算法称为回溯法，它适用于解一些组合数较大的问题。

## Recursion 

### Study notes

Recursion is especially suitable when **the input is expressed using recursive rules.** 

Recursion is a good choice for **search, enumeration, and divide-and-conquer.** 

Use recursion as **alternative to deeply nested iteration loops**. For example, recursion is much better when you have an undefined number of levels, such as the IP address problem generalized to k substrings. 

If you are asked to **remove recursion** from a program, consider mimicking call stack with the **stack data structure**.

Recursion can be easily removed from a **tail-recursive** program by using a while- loop—no stack is needed. (Optimizing compilers do this.) 

If a recursive function may end up being called with **the same arguments** more than once, cache the results—this is the idea behind Dynamic Programming.
