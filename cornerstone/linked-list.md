![linked list](https://i.imgur.com/xwQ842u.png)

> A linked list is a linear data structure, the elements are not stored **at contiguous memory locations**. The elements in a linked list are linked using **pointers**.

## 基础知识

List problems often have a simple brute-force solution that uses 0(n) space, but a subtler solution that uses **the existing list nodes** to reduce space complexity to 0(1). 

Very often, a problem on lists is conceptually simple, and is more about **cleanly coding what's specified**, rather than designing an algorithm.

Consider using **a dummy head** (sometimes referred to as a sentinel) to avoid having to check for empty lists. This simplifies code, and makes bugs less likely. 

It's easy to forget **to update next** (and previous for double linked list) for the head and tail.

Algorithms operating on singly linked lists often benefit from using **two iterators**, one ahead of the other, or **one advancing quicker than the other**. 
 
## 典型应用

- dummy node: [2](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)
- delete in O(1): moditfy the value or pointer 
- two pointer (fast/slow pointers)
	- detect cycle 
	- get the middle node 
	- get the kth from last node 
- reverse: [25](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/), [92](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/description/), [206](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/)
- merge: merge k 

## 最佳实践

- [create](https://repl.it/@WillWang42/linked-list)
- insert (front, given node, end)
- adding a dummy node ([LC117](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/), LC146)
- add
- deletiton: modify(values, LC450) or change(pointers)
- sort([LC147](https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list/description/)) 
- recursively (reverse linked-list)
- count, **reverse**, find the middle, merge

### node class 

``` python 
Class Node:
	def __init__(self, val):
		self.val = val
		self.next = None 
```

### reverse 

``` python
def reverse_node(head):
	cur, pre = head, None
	while cur:
		cur.next, pre, cur = pre, cur, cur.next 
	return pre
"""
   pre   -> cur -> cur.nxt 
 cur.nxt <- pre <- cur 
"""	
```

### merge

``` python
def merge_two(l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    if l1 and l2:
        if l1.val > l2.val: 
            l1, l2 = l2, l1 
        l1.next = merge_two(l1.next, l2)
    return l1 or l2 
```

### add

``` python
def add_two_numbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    carry = 0
    n = dummy = ListNode(0)
    while l1 or l2 or carry:
        v1 = v2 = 0
        if l1:
            v1 += l1.val
            l1 = l1.next 
        if l2:
            v2 += l2.val
            l2 = l2.next 
        carry, val = divmod(v1+v2+carry, 10)
        n.next = ListNode(val)
        n = n.next
    return dummy.next 
```

### delete 

``` python
# to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, 
# given only access to that node.
def delete_node(self, node):
    node.val  = node.next.val
    node.next = node.next.next
```

### middle

``` python
def middle_node(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next 
        fast = fast.next.next 
    return slow
```

### reverse k 

``` python
def reverse_k_group(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
    # 1. edge case 
    if k < 2: return head 
    
    # 2. base case 
    node = head 
    for _ in range(k):
        if not node: 
            return head
        node = node.next 
    
    # 3. reverse 
    cur, pre = head, None
    for _ in range(k):
        cur.next, pre, cur = pre, cur, cur.next 
    
    # 4. recursive 
    head.next = reverse_k_group(cur, k)
    return pre
```

### merge sort 

``` python
# merge sort
def sort_list(self, head):
    """
    :type head: ListNode
    :rtype: ListNode
    """
    # base case 
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head

    # divide list into two parts
    fast, slow = head.next, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
    second = slow.next
    slow.next = None

    l = self.sort_list(head)
    r = self.sort_list(second)
    return self.merge_two(l, r)
``` 

### corner cases

- `None`
- Single node 
- Two nodes
- Linked list has cycle. Clarify with the interviewer whether there can be a cycle in the list. Usually the answer is no.
