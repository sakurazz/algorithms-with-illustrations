> **Stack** is a linear data structure which follows **a particular order** in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

## 基础知识

Learn to recognize when the stack **LIFO** property is applicable. For example, **parsing** typically benefits from a stack. 

Consider augmenting the basic stack or queue data structure to support additional operations, such as **finding the maximum element**. 

### core

- [ ] the typical use of stack can be abstracted into a depth-first walk?

## 典型应用


- LIFO: [901](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/)
- **save for later**: parsing, [394](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)
- **special order**: discrete ascending or descending, [84](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)
- **next greater**: [496](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)
- top-down (DFS-style): tree, [173](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-iterator/)

## 最佳实践

### general (DFS style)

``` python 
# to maintain an order in the stack (= save for later)
# e.g. LC1019, nearest largest 
for i, num in enumerate(input):
	# base case 
	while stack and compare(num, stack[-1]):
		# hit the bottom 
		last = stack.pop()
		# caculate...
	# general case 
	stack.append(i)
```

### dummy value (nearest largest) 

``` python
def largest_rectangle_area(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
    heights.append(0)             # dummy value 
    stack = [(float("-inf"), -1)] # dummy value: val, pos 
    ans = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(heights):
        while num < stack[-1][0]: # no while stack and ...
            h = stack.pop()[0]
            w = i - stack[-1][1] - 1
            ans = max(ans, h * w)
        stack.append((num, i))
    return ans
```

### save for later 

``` python
def decode_string(self, s: str) -> str:
    stack = []
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char == "]":
            letters = ""
            while stack and stack[-1] != "[":
                letters = stack.pop() + letters
            stack.pop() # pop "["
            digits = ""
            while stack and stack[-1].isdigit():
                digits = stack.pop() + digits 
            stack.append(int(digits) * letters)
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    return "".join(stack)
```

```
s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".
s = "10[a]", return "aaaaaaaaaa".
```

## Explain

- [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
	- It is the same as the question that just have one kind of bracket. We use a hashmap to store the relationship between open and close brackets. Now, hashmap is an abstraction of **brackets** relationship.
		- **Push** the present character into stack if it's an opening symbol else **pop** a character from stack and **check** if it matches with the present character ( if it matches don't do anything else immediately return `false` )
		- **Note** - At any point of time if stack is empty and present character is a closing bracket return `false` immediately
		- **Termination** - if stack is empty return `true` else return `false`	

## Q & A

1. stack 和 heap 有什么区别？
	- 都在维持某种顺序，而stack通过pop()和push()完成，而heap需要进入容器之后二次处理得到。
	- Stack: Last in, First out -> When pop? -> Discrete Order (需要照顾原始数组Index)
	- Heap: Last in, Best out (定制化能力更强)
	- Queue: First in, First out
2. stack的优化有什么？
	- 如果不关注过程，只在乎结果。可以使用变量`count`来标记，空间由`O(n)`到`O(1)`, 如[LC 1021](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-outermost-parentheses/), 请试着用stack和count分别解决。是不是有一种在DP中，二维cache压缩成一维的感觉。
